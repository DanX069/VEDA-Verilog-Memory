# VEDA-Verilog-Memory
This a Verilog implementation of a memory called VEDA for course CS220 at IIT Kanpur.
VEDA a single port memory of dimension 32 Ã— 32. This means that
the depth of the memory is 32 and the width of the memory is 32 bits. A block diagram of this memory
is shown in Figure 1. This memory operates into two different modes: scribble when mode=0 and interpret
when mode=1. In scribble mode, the input data is written to the memory and driven on the data output. In
interpret mode, the data previously written in the memory will be provided the output. In both the cases,
the data will appear at the output port after one clock cycle delay of providing address value.

The testbench code for simulation of this memory is also given

A modified version of VEDA is also implemented as shown in Figure 2. Here the memory has two
different address ports addrss_a and address_b. The addrss_a port is used to write in to the memory and
addrss_b is used to read from the memory. Write a Verilog code for this architecture. Note that addrss_a
and addrss_b can not be of the same value.
